Commonly used aerospace materials:
- Wood
- Steel
- Aluminum alloys
- Titanum alloys
- Magnesium alloys
- Nickel alloys
- Fiber-reinforced composites

Factors for selecting materials
- Function
- Material properties
    - Strength-to-weight ratio
    - Stiffness
    - Toughness
    - Resistance to corrosion
    - Fatigue and effects of environmental heating
    - Machinability
    - Availability
    - Consistency

The average commercial aircraft has a 30-year life cycle, in service for 60,000 flight hours, 20,000 flights, and 100,000 miles of taxiing (which could go 4 times around the earth's circumference).

Flight stresses
- Pressure differential between fuselage and outside
- Temperature differential between ground to cruise
- Impact load of landing

Reducing material density reduces airframe weight and improves performance. Material density reductions are 3 to 5 times more effective than increasing tensile strength, modulus, or impact resistance.

Early aircraft built of wood
- Wright brothers used Spruce
- Widely available
- Mostly uniform piece to piece
- Good strength-to-weight ratio
- Different properties in different directions
- Easy fabrication and repair
- Sensitivity to moisture
- Rot and insect damage
- Natural product lower consistency than man-made

More commonly, Metal Alloy
- Aluminum Alloy
    - Cutting-edge (1920s-60s)
    - Most abundant metal in the earth's crust
    - Pure aluminum is relatively soft
    - Currently most widely-used material
    - Readily formed
    - Moderate cost
    - Excellent resistance to chemical corrosion
    - Excellent strength-to-weight ratio
    - Strength and stiffness are affected by
        - Form
            - Sheet
            - Plate
            - Bar
            - Extrusion
            - Forging
        - Heat treating and tempering
        - Stronger aluminum is more brittle
    - Aluminum's downside is that it has a relatively low melting point (~600C)
- Steel alloy
    - Very cheep
    - Easy to fabricate
    - First utilized in fuselage constructio
    - Excellent strength
    - High fatigue resistance
    - High meting point
    - Poor strength-to-weight ratio
    - Alloy of iron and carbon
        - Carbon adds strength to soft iron
        - As carbon content inreases, strength and brittleness increase
        - Typical steel alloys are 1% carbon
