# Gameplay
### The Grid
- 3x9 grid of "nodes"
- Pieces on nodes grant points
    - Bottom row
        - 3 in auto
        - 2 in teleop
    - Middle row
        - 4 in auto
        - 3 in teleop
    - Top row
        - 6 in auto
        - 5 in teleop
- 3 pieces in a row is a link
    - 5 points per link
    - Pieces can only be in a single link; No piece may be in multiple links at once (so 4 pieces in a row is not 2 links, but 6 in a row is)
    - 5 links on the grid = 1 ranking point (sustainability bonus)
- Bottom row is all "dual nodes", which can fit either cubes or cones
- Other two rows have either cube nodes or cone nodes
    - ðŸ”ºðŸŸªðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸŸªðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸŸªðŸ”º
- Divided into 3 3x3 grids
    - The middle one is the "coopertition grid"
    - 3 pieces in coopertition grid decreases sustainability bonus threshold by 1 (from 5 links to 4)
### The Substations
- Substations are used to deliver pieces from outside of the arena to the robots
- 2 kinds of substation
    - Single substation
        - 1 chute
        - Drop pieces down onto the floor
    - Double substation
        - 2 sliding trays
        - Place piece onto tray, slide tray sideways so robot can access it
        - Also the option to drop a piece onto the floor
- Team 5115 will be prioritizing the double substation
### The Charging Station
- Balance board thing
- Almost entirely blocks access to the community zone in which the grid lies
- There are small spaces on either side of it, but it's a tight turn to make (still doable)
- At the end of each phase, robots on the charging station grant points
    - 2 states
        - Docked
            - Robot fully supported by the charging station
        - Engaged
            - Charging station is level (indicated by light strip under the transparent platform)
    - At the end of auto, docked/engaged points can only be scored by 1 robot (2 robots docked and/or engaged would not net 2 robot's worth of points)
    - End of auto
        - Docked = 8 pts
        - Docked + engaged = 12 pts
    - End of teleop
        - Docked = 6 pts
        - Docked + engaged = 10 pts
- If at least 26 points were earned from being docked and/or engaged on the charging station, 1 ranking point is given (activation bonus)

|                         | No teleop dock/engage | 1 teleop dock | 2 teleop docks | 3 teleop docks | 1 teleop engage | 2 teleop engage | 3 teleop engage |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Auto engage**         | 12                    | 18            | 24             | ***30***         | 22              | ***32***          | ***42***          |
| **Auto dock**           | 8                     | 14            | 20             | ***26***         | 18              | ***28***          | ***38***          |
| **No auto dock/engage** | 0                     | 6             | 12             | 18             | 10              | 20              | ***30***          |

# Driver Station Status LED Strip
At the driver station, there is an RGB LED strip that indicates the status of the game.

Light patterns layer as alliances score throughout the match.

# Interesting Notes
Points are on a node basis rather than a piece basis. A full node = points, rather than a piece on the grid = points. So, if a piece is removed from a node, points are lost. If the same piece is placed on a node with a different point value, the different point value is gained. For example:  
- In teleop, a cube is placed in the bottom row, then moved to the top row. Only 5 points are gained.
- In teleop, a cube is placed in the top row, then moved to the bottom row. Only 2 points are gained.

If a piece is placed on a node during auto, for the rest of the match, it will provide auto points rather than teleop. For example:
- In auto, a cube is placed on the bottom row. Then, in teleop, it is moved to the top row. However, following this, a cone is placed in the node that was once filled by the aforementioned cube. 5 points are gained for the cube in the top row, and 3 points are gained for the cone in the node which was filled during auto.
# Defitions
### CONTROL
The state of a game piece if any of the following are true:
- The game piece is fully supported by the robot
- The robot is intentionally moving a game piece to a desired location or in a preferred direction
### Foul
5 game points to opponent alliance
### Tech Foul
12 game points to opponent alliance
### Yellow card
Warning - 2 yellow cards = red card = disqualification
