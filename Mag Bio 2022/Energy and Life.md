# Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondrion. 1 Glucose and 6 $O_2$ yield 6 water, 6 $CO_2$, and 36-38 ATP  
$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + ATP$
- Glycolysis in the cytoplasm breaks down glucose in to 2 ATP and 2 pyruvates
- The Citric Acid Cycle (AKA the Krebs Cycle) takes place in the mitochondrion
- Oxidative phosphorylation also takes place in the mitochondrion

# Photosynthesis - December 19, 2022
Photosynthesis takes place in the many chloroplasts in a plant cell. 6 $CO_2$, 6 water, and light yield 1 glucose and 6 $O_2$  
$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6CO_2$
- Light reactions in the thylakoid membrane produce $O_2$, ATP, and NADPH
- The Clavin Cycle in the stroma uses $CO_2$, ATP, and NADPH to make carbohydrates such as sugars

It is important to note that ***the products of cellular respiration are the reactants of photosynthesis*** (sans light), and ***the products of photosynthesis are the reactants of cellular respiration***.

## Types of Respiration
### Anaerobic Respiration
- Pyruvate is converted into other compounds
    - Specific compounds depend on the organism
- No more ATP is generated
- Also called fermentation
### Aerobic Respiration
- Pyruvate is taken to the mitochondrion
- Oxygen is used
- ~34-35 additional ATP are generated in the mitochondrial processes
- $H_2O$ and $CO_2$ are released
## Fermentation
The products of anaerobic respiration vary and contribute to the name of the type of fermentation
### Lactic Acid Fermentation
- Our muscles cells convert the pyruvate to lactic acid and $CO_2$
- The lactic acid is what causes muscle soreness
- Many foods are made using lactic acid fermentation by various types of bacteria
### Alcohol Fermentation
- Some yeast and bacterial cells convert pyruvate to ethyl alcohol and $CO_2$
- This is how bread rises and some alcoholic beverages are made
