## Notes

### Characteristics of Life

- Organization
    - All life is made of cells
- Homeostasis
    - Certain things need to be kept in balance (temp, PH)
    - A living thing must be able to maintain this balance
- Reproduction
    - Cell regeneration and growth fulfills this category
- Growth and development
- Response to stimuli
- Evolution

### Obtaining and Using Energy

Glucose is a form of chemical energy. Breaking the chemical bonds releases energy that can be used to move other molecueles (motion) or store din other bonds (chemical).

Glucose: $H_6C_{12}O_6$

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is also chemical energy. It is more efficient than any other molecule at providing usable energy or cells. All known living things use ATP to power their cells. Breaks apart into phosphate and ADP. ADP gets refilled for reuse.

ATP: $C_{10}H_{16}N_5O_{13}P_3$  
ADP: $C_{10}H_{15}N_5O_{10}P_2$  
Phosphate: $[PO_4]^{3+}$

### Elements of Life

While the periodic table shows over 100 elements, only a handful of these are critically important in living organisms, and most are only ever seen in artificial conditions.

Big ones:

- Hydrogen, $H$
- Carbon, $C$
- Nitrogen, $N$
- Oxygen, $O$
- Phosphorus, $P$
- Sulfur, $S$

These elements are critical for building the molecules that ake up the structure of living bodies.

Important elements as ions:

- Sodium, $Na$
- Magnesium, $Mg$
- Chlorine, $Cl$
- Potassium, $K$
- Calcium, $Ca$
- Iron, $Fe$

These elements are critical for many of the processes that occur in an organism's body

### Organic and Inorganic Molecules

Organic molecules **must** have carbon. They generally have carbon-hydrogen or carbon-carbon bonds. Chemically, "organic" has nothing to do with "healthy" or "good for you".

### Building Upwards

Small molecules can be joined together to form larger structures caled **macromolecules**. ***Monomers*** (one unit) are molecules that can be linked together to form larger ***polymers*** (many units)

### Boilogically important polymers

There are four categores of biologically important polymers:

- Carbohydrates
    - Broken down into glucose
- Lipids
    - Has many jobs, shares a few with proteins
    - Produces hormones
    - Help digest fat
- Proteins
    - Do most of the work, i.e. transport, structural support, reaction catalyzation
- Nucleic Acids
    - ***DNA and RNA!!!***

Each has unique monomers and specific characteristics

### Biologically Important Monomers

- Glycerol OR cholesterol backbone + 3 fatty acids; Lipids
    - $C$
    - $H$
    - $O$
    - Sometimes
        - $P$
        - $N$
        - $S$
        - Other
- Amino acid; Protein
    - $C$
    - $H$
    - $O$
    - $N$
    - Amino - Amine group ($NH_2R^1$, $NHR^1R^2$, $NR^1R^2R^3$). MUST HAVE NITROGEN
- Nucleotide; Nucleic acid
    - $N$
    - $O$
    - $C$
    - $P$
    - $H$
- Monosacharide; Carbohydrate
    - $C$
    - $H$
    - $O$

# Anabolism and Catabolism - December 6, 2022

## Notes

### Anabolism and Catabolism

Catabolism is the process of breaking things down (i.e. digestion). Anabolism is the opposite, putting things together. Hydrolysis is a type of catabolism where a water molecule reacts with a biological polymer to split it into its monomic components. Dehydration synthesis is the anabolic counterpart to hydrolysis.
