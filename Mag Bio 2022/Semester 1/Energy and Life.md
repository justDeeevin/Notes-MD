# Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondrion. 1 Glucose and 6 $O_2$ yield 6 water, 6 $CO_2$, and 36-38 ATP  
$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + ATP$

- Glycolysis in the cytoplasm breaks down glucose in to 2 ATP and 2 pyruvates
- The Citric Acid Cycle (AKA the Krebs Cycle) takes place in the mitochondrion
- Oxidative phosphorylation also takes place in the mitochondrion

# Photosynthesis - December 19, 2022

Photosynthesis takes place in the many chloroplasts in a plant cell. 6 $CO_2$, 6 water, and light yield 1 glucose and 6 $O_2$  
$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6CO_2$

- Light reactions in the thylakoid membrane produce $O_2$, ATP, and NADPH
- The Clavin Cycle in the stroma uses $CO_2$, ATP, and NADPH to make carbohydrates such as sugars

It is important to note that ***the products of cellular respiration are the reactants of photosynthesis*** (sans light), and ***the products of photosynthesis are the reactants of cellular respiration***.

## Types of Respiration

### Anaerobic Respiration

- Pyruvate is converted into other compounds
    - Specific compounds depend on the organism
- No more ATP is generated
- Also called fermentation

### Aerobic Respiration

- Pyruvate is taken to the mitochondrion
- Oxygen is used
- ~34-35 additional ATP are generated in the mitochondrial processes
- $H_2O$ and $CO_2$ are released

## Fermentation

The products of anaerobic respiration vary and contribute to the name of the type of fermentation

### Lactic Acid Fermentation

- Our muscles cells convert the pyruvate to lactic acid and $CO_2$
- The lactic acid is what causes muscle soreness
- Many foods are made using lactic acid fermentation by various types of bacteria

### Alcohol Fermentation

- Some yeast and bacterial cells convert pyruvate to ethyl alcohol and $CO_2$
- This is how bread rises and some alcoholic beverages are made

# Nutrient Cycles - January 3, 2022

The law of conservation of mass must be followed and, as such, in order to support the ecosystem, the many nutrients necessary for life are always moving around in what are called cycles (e.g. the water cycle). The carbon cycle (and other nutrient cycles) aren't *really* cycles, but are closer to webs. Elements move between the different reservoirs:

- Atmosphere - air
- Biosphere - life
- Hydrosphere - water
- Lithosphere - rock/stone

Left to themselves, the nutrient cycles are entirely balanced, in an equilibrium. However, with human meddling (grrrr...), they can be disrupted.
