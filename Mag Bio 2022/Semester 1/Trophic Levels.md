# Trophic levels - November 3, 2022
- [Key Terms](#key-terms)
- [Notes](#notes)
    - [Trancendentalist walk](#transcendentalist-walk)
## Key terms
- Niche
    - Unique key role that a species plays in an ecosystem. No two species occupy the same niche
- Autotroph
    - Makes its own food (I.E. photosynthesis)
- Heterotroph
    - Eats other organisms
- Omnivore
    - Eats all kinds of organisms
- Carnivore
    - Eats animals
- Herbivore
    - Eats plants
- Detritavore
    - Eats dead biomass - think mushrooms and decomposition
## Notes 
- Troph - refers to feeding or energy
- Levels
    1. Primary heterotrophs
    2. Secondary heterotrophs
    3. Tertiary heterotrophs
- This continues...
- Bottom - autotrophs
### Transcendentalist walk
- The only animals I saw were small bugs. There were only these little white dudes hovering around and I couldn't identify what kind of bug they were. There was also a single little crawly bug that was able to walk on the water in the stream.
- There were a **lot** of trees. One thing that was interesting to observe was the individual leaves falling.
- There was a noticeable gradient in leaf color from green to yellow to orange from the floor to the top of the trees.
- I saw no real examples of competition or interaction between organisms.
- There was a thin film on the surface of the still water. At first I thought it was a lighting effect, but after someone near me began stirring the water around a bit (I was going to focus on the ripples), I noticed the film dissipate.
# Keystone Species and Trophic Cascades - November 4, 2022
- [Notes](#notes-1)
## Notes
- Keystone species, as the name suggests, are species that are depended upon by a large number of other species.
- Keystone species can be on any trophic level.
- When keystone species of an ecosystem are diminished or removed, the effect is a [_trophic cascade_](###trophic-cascades)

# Predators and prey - November 9, 2022
- [Notes](#notes-2)
    - [The Green World Hypothesis](#the-green-world-hypothesis)
    - [Trophic Cascades](#trophic-cascades)
## Notes
### The Green World Hypothesis
- Predators are needed to keep herbivore numbers at or below carrying capacity
- This is different than "bottom-up" ideas, which say the number of herbivores is determined by the amount of plant biomass
- **Both Green World and Bottom-Up hypotheses are overly simplistic views of ecosystems**
### Trophic Cascades
- Chain reaction of relationships
    - When I remove a species, how are other species affected?
    - Which species are dependent on which other species?
- Example
    - Snails eat grass in the salt marsh
    - Snails eat the grass faster than it can grow when not kept in check
    - Blue crabs eat the snails
    - If the blue crabs were removed, the snail popultion would skyrocket and the grass population would be decimated
    - If the grass were removed, the snails wouldn't have anything to feed on and the crabs would likely struggle to survive
    - Without snails, the grass would thrive and the crabs would likely struggle to survive without snails to feed on
# Ecosystem Resiliency - November 10, 2022
- [Notes](#notes-3)
## Notes
- For an ecosystem to effectively heal following a disaster, it has to be healthy
- High biodiversity = healthy ecosystem
- Biodiversity and survival of keystone species determines whether or not an ecosystem recovers
