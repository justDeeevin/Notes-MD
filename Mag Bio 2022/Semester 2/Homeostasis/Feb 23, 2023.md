## The cell cycle

All cells, regardless of being in a unicellular or multicellular organism, go through some aspect of a *cell cycle* of growth, development, and division.

There are 4 steps to the cell cycle:

- G<sub>1</sub> (Gap 1)
- S (Synthesis)
- G<sub>2</sub> (Gap 2)
- M (Mitosis)
    - Prophase (Pro- -- the start)
    - Metaphase (Meta- -- everything gets centered)
    - Anaphase (Ana- -- duplication)
    - Telophase (Telo- -- the end)
    - Cytokinesis

G<sub>0</sub> is a "resting" stage, when a cell is either *quiescent* or *senescent*. Following mitosis, cells are in the G<sub>0</sub> stage for an indefinite amount of time. Some cells divide more rapidly than others.
