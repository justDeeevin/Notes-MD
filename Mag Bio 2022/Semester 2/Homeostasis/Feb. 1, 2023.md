## Phospholipids
The cell membrane is made up of phospholipids which, unlike standard lipids, are made up of 2 fatty acids and a phosphate molecule. The phosphate head is hydrophilic (polar), and the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (nonpolar). 
### What can get across the membrane?
Small, nonpolar molecules, small, uncharged polar molecules, and large, nonpolar molecules can pass through. Large, uncharged polar molecules and all ions cannot get through.
