## Diffusion

When conditions are different on different sides of the cell membrane, it will try to reattain equilibrium with a process called diffusion, where it purposefully moves substances through itself. When water is moved with diffusion, it is known as osmosis. Osmosis takes place when water concentration is different on either side of the cell membrane. Water is always moving in and out, but when osmosis occurs, more water moves to one side than to the other.

When a solution has too much water and not enough solute, it is known as hypotonic. When a solution has too little water and too much solute, it is known as hypertonic. When a solution is in equilibrium with the inside of the cell, it is known as isotonic.
