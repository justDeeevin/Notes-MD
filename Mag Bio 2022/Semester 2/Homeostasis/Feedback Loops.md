## Feedback loops

In order to maintain homeostasis, organisms need to respond to stimuli. For instance, in order to maintain a healthy temperature, warm-blooded organisms need to recognize if the temperature is getting too high or low and respond accordingly. There are negative and positive feedback loops. Negative feedback loops counteract detected stimuli (e.g. making the body warmer in response to a decreased temperature), while positive feedback loops enhance detected stimuli (e.g. childbirth). There are 6 parts to a negative feedback loop:

- Stimuli is received
- Receptor organ detects it
- Control center receives message from receptor and processes stimuli
- Effector is told by control center to send feedback
- Effect takes place
