## Pro/Eukaryotes
Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, and prokaryotic cells have neither. Eukaryotes have linear chromosomes while prokaryotes have circular chromosomes. 

### Mitochondrion
Mitochondria appear in eukaryotes. They perform cellular respiration, and they also metabolize many molecues found in food.

### Chloroplast
Chloroplasts appear in prokaryotes. They perform photosynthesis.

### Ribosome
Ribosomes appear in both eu- and prokaryotes. They transport RNA from the neucleus to wherever it needs to go.

### Lysosome
Lysosomes appear in eukaryotes. They carry digestive enzymes, break down old cell parts, are used to fight bacteria and viruses, and initiate cell death.

### Golgi body
Golgi bodies apear in eukaryotes. They sort proteins sent from the endoplasmic reticulum and send them to their proper destination. In plant cells, Golgi bodies create the comonents of the cell wall.

### Vacuole
Vacuoles appear in both eu- and prokaryotes. They handle waste products, and are very important for homeostasis.

### Rough endoplasmic reticulum
Rough endoplasmic reticulums appear in eukaryotes. They synthesize proteins which are sent to the Golgi body.

### Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
Smooth endoplasmic reticulums appear in eukaryotes. They synthesize lipids, steroids, and hormones. They also metabolize carbohydrates. In muscle cells, they store calcium ions.

### Centrosome
Centrosomes appear in eukaryotes. They provide structure to a cell, like a skeleton.

### Peroxisome
Peroxisomes appear in eukaryotes. They carry enzymes that break down toxic substances.
