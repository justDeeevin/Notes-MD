# Key Vocab

- *Chromosome*: supercoiled DNA and protein structure
- *Chromatid*: one half of a duplicated chromosome
    - The pari of chromatids are called *sister chroatids*
- *Centromere*: the area where isster chromatids are still connected
- *Telomeres*: the ends of the chromatids
- *Homologous Chromosomes*: a pair of chromosomes that have the same genes in the same locations
- *Heterologous Chromosomes*: a pair of chromosomes that have different genes in the same locations

# Notes

## Nucleic Acid Structure

How does a nucleotide become a nucleic acid? First of all, know that a nucleotide has three parts:

- A sugar (pentose)
- A phosphate
- A nitrogenous base
    - Adenine
    - Guanine
    - Cytosine
    - Thymine
    -Uracil

## Naming and Numbering

Pentose sugars always are in the shape of a pentagon. There is an oxygen atom at the top of the pentagon. The carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered clockwise, starting tot he right of the oxygen.

Nucleotides are named after the nitrogenous bases, and when they exist individually are actually a triphosphate! The *full* abbreviation for any of the various nucleotides als includes a lowercase letter for the pentose. For example, the nucleotides in DNA are dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP.

## Mix 'n Match

Erwin Chargaff noticed something when he was studying DNA.

The percentage of *purine* nucleotides (adenine and guanine) in a DNA sample was almost ~50%. The other ~50% of the sample was complsed of *pyrimidine* nucleotides (cytosine and thymine). The percentage of *adenine* nucleotides was approximately equal to the percentage of *thymine* nucleotides. At the same time, the percentage of *cytosine* and *guanine* were about equal.

Nucleotides bond at their base pair using hydrogen bonds.
