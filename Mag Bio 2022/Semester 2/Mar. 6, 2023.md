# Notes

## DNA Replication

- Enzymes speed up DNA replication
    - ***DNA polymerase***
        - I and III (don't ask about II)
    - Primase
    - Ligase
    - Swivelase (topoisomerase)
    - Helicase
    - Separase
- Three essential steps:
    - Unwind
    - Unzip (break the hydrogen bonds between bases)
    - Add new nucleotides

There are 2 strands in DNA replication, the leading strand and the lagging strand.
