# Notes

## The roles of enzymes in DNA replication

### Swivelase

Swivelase, also known as topoisomerase, comes first. It uncoils the helix by creating "nicks". Should it fail, the DNA's compression would go uncontrolled and it would supercoil, breaking it and preventing its replication. This stunts the cell cycle.

### Helicase

Helicase comes second. It breaks Hydrogen Bonds, separating the two DNA strands. Should helicase not function properly, anything related to DNA or RNA will stop functioning. Put simply, death.

### Primase

Primase comes third. It initiates the synthesis of new DNA. If primase doesn't function properly, short RNA primers will not be synthesized. Primase is required to initiate polymer synthesis.

### Polymerase III

DNA polymerase III comes fourth. It adds nucleotides to the 3' end of RNA primer. Should polymerase III fail, DNA mutations could occur, potentially causing cell death or cancer.

### DNA Polymerase I

DNA polymerase I comes fifth, and second to last. It replaces all remaining RNA primer with DNA, in essence finishing what polymerase III started. Should it fail, a cell will die, and reproduction will fail.

### Ligase

Ligase is the last enzyme in the process of DNA replication. It facilitates the joining of DNA strands. It can repair single-strand DNA breaks and sometimes multi-strand DNA breaks. It connects Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. Should ligase fail, DNA will be fragmented and will not be to replicate properly. This will fail the S-phase checkpoint.

## Separase

Separase comes into play between the metaphase and the anaphase of mitosis. It separates sister chromatids into individual ones. Should it fail, the sister chromatids will not separate. This will cause Aneuploidy, where one daughter cell has too little genetic material and the other has too much.
