# Notes

## RNA Transcription

RNA transcription is the first part of protein synthesis. Enzymes speed it up, and the most important enzyme in the process is RNA polymerase. Transcription is similar to DNA replication.

In RNA transcription, *transcription factors* attach to the area to attract the RNA polymerase. The steps are:

- Unwind
    - Only at the gene being transcribed
- Unzip
    - Only at the gene being transcribed
- Add in RNA nucleotides to the template (3' -> 5') strand
- RNA strand peels off
- Re-zip/re-wind the DNA

## Methylation

The methyl group is $CH_3$, and is attached to other things. When DNA strands have methyl groups attached, they are unable to be read by transcription factors. The process of attaching methyl groups to DNA is called methylation.

## Gene Splicing

There are multiple types of RNA. *Gene splicing* occurs after transcription to form mRNA. Other types of RNA are formed through other gene editing processes.

## RNA Editing

We mentioned that RNA editing removes *introns* and stitches together *exons* to make mRNA. RNA editing also adds a *poly-A tail* to the mRNA, and a methylated "cap" to the beginning. The poly-A tail and the methylated cap protects the mRNA from accidental destruction by random exonucleases.

After transcription, the RNA is edited to become one of three primary types of RNA:

- mRNA
    - Most transcription makes mRNA
    - Messenger to the ribosome
    - Specific instructions for making a protein
- tRNA
    - Transports amino acids to the ribosome
    - Have an "anticodon" to pair with codon on the mRNA
    - 61 tRNAs
- rRNA
    - Part of the physical ribosome structure
    - "reads" the mRNA and links together the amino acids brought by the tRNA
    - Two subunits

## Translation

Translation is the process of converting genetic information into proteins. mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA all come together to link amino acids together to form proteins. Like any recipe, there is a "start with this step here" signal - in this case, it's the word, or ***codon***, AUG. There is also a "stop" signal for the end of the recipe.
